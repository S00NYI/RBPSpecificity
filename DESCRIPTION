Description:
    Provides tools to analyze RNA Binding Protein (RBP) binding characteristics
    from high-throughput sequencing data. Capabilities include calculating
    K-mer enrichment, Inherent Specificity (IS) scores, and Mutational
    Sensitivity (MS) profiles, along with visualization methods.
    For detailed methodology and applications, please refer to our manuscript
    (see URL field or vignette).
