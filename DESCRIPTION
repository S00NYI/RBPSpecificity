Title: RBP Inherent Specificity and Mutational Sensitivity Analysis Tool
Version: 1.1.1
Description:
    Provides tools to analyze RNA Binding Protein (RBP) binding specificities
    from high-throughput sequencing data. Functions include calculating
    K-mer enrichment, Inherent Specificity (IS), and Mutational
    Sensitivity (MS), along with visualization of IS and MS.
    For detailed methodology and applications, please refer to our manuscript
    (see URL field or vignette).
