\title{Generate Batched Background Sequences Across Multiple Iterations}
\usage{
generateBkgSetBatched(
  peak_gr,
  genome_obj,
  min_seq_length,
  bkg_min_dist,
  bkg_max_dist,
  scramble,
  n_iter
)
}
\arguments{
\item{peak_gr}{A GRanges object representing the original genomic peaks.}

\item{genome_obj}{A BSgenome object.}

\item{min_seq_length}{Integer, minimum length for extracted sequences.}

\item{bkg_min_dist}{Integer, minimum absolute shift distance.}

\item{bkg_max_dist}{Integer, maximum absolute shift distance.}

\item{scramble}{Logical, whether to scramble sequences.}

\item{n_iter}{Integer, number of iterations to batch.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements:
  \describe{
    \item{sequences}{A DNAStringSet of all background sequences.}
    \item{iter_tags}{Integer vector of iteration indices (1 to n_iter),
      same length as sequences, indicating which iteration each sequence
      belongs to.}
  }
}
\description{
Batched version of \code{\link{generateBkgSet}} that processes
  multiple iterations at once, reducing per-call overhead for GRanges shifting,
  overlap removal, and sequence extraction.
