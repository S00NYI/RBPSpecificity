\title{Get Sequences from GRanges}
\usage{
getSequence(granges_obj, genome_obj, extension = c(0, 0), min_length = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{granges_obj}{A GRanges object.}

\item{genome_obj}{A BSgenome object.}

\item{extension}{A numeric vector of length 2: `c(five_prime, three_prime)`.
Positive values extend the range, negative values trim the range.
Extension/trimming is strand-aware:
- For + strand (and * strand): 5'-end is start, 3'-end is end
- For - strand: 5'-end is end, 3'-end is start
Default: `c(0, 0)` (no change).}

\item{min_length}{Integer, the minimum acceptable length of a range after
any extension/trimming. Ranges shorter than this will be removed.
Default: 1.}
}
\value{
A DNAStringSet object containing the extracted sequences. Names of the
  sequences in the set will correspond to the names of the processed GRanges
  object (if names were present on the input and preserved). Original metadata
  columns are preserved on the intermediate GRanges object used for sequence
  extraction. Returns an empty DNAStringSet if input `granges_obj` is empty
  or if all ranges are filtered out.
}
\description{
Extracts DNA sequences for a set of genomic ranges from a
  BSgenome object. Optionally extends or trims ranges from their 5'-end
  and/or 3'-end in a strand-aware manner, filters by minimum length, and
  ensures ranges are valid within chromosome boundaries. Original metadata
  columns (`mcols`) and names from the input `granges_obj` are preserved
  for the ranges that successfully yield sequences.
